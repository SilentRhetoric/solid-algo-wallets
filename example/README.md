 The Solid Algo Wallets Example provides a working demonstration of a SolidJS web application that integrates Algorand wallets via the [solid-algo-wallets](https://github.com/SilentRhetoric/solid-algo-wallets) library.

## Quick Start

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  The page will reload if you make edits.

## Deployment

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run build`

This builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (e.g. Netlify).
